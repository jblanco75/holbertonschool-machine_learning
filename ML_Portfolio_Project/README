This implementation is a first approach to a possible reinforcement learning solution applied to trading. The possibilities are very wide since there are many variables to consider and adjust by observing the performance of the different algorithms. Initially an A2C was used, but we intend to test also A3C and DQN, in different scenarios to evaluate their performance as well.
It should be noted that the positive performance depends on many factors to consider, from the adjustment of the hyperparameters, to the correct question to ask the model.
Most implementations seek to obtain some form of prediction that indicates the action to be taken, but in the following what will be tested is the approach to be adopted.
